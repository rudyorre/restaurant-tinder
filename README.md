# restaurant-tinder
A restaurant matching web application that helps users decide which restaurant to eat at. It allows the user to input their cuisine, location, price, etc. preferences as a saved filter profile. From this filter profile, users can either approve or disapprove each restaurant one at a time and also see more in depth information about it. The user can also make notes about their orders for restaurants theyâ€™ve approved of.
